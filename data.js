I have a degree in mechanical engineering and is approved by NOKUT.To improve my skills, I am completing programming courses and looking for a new job where I can use my practical skills and become part of a great team. I also need a position where I can use my engineering and programming knowledge. It can also be an opportunity for me to develop both professionally and personally. I have diverse experiences. My last job was as a farm manager and I had different types of work: maintenance of machines and various equipment, improvement of equipment and replacement of models for better equipment operation, animal care. I also have experience from Denmark and Ukraine. I worked with both administrative and manual tasks and enjoyed both. I consider myself as a positive person, I am structured and decision-oriented, I am ready to take responsibility. I learn quickly and gain new knowledge easily. I hope to have the opportunity to introduce myself in person."
